ðŸš€ A blazing-fast, Polars-powered reimplementation of [`ffn`](https://github.com/pmorissette/ffn) for portfolio analytics and performance measurement.

## âœ¨ What is this?

`ffn-polars` is a modern rewrite of the original `ffn` library using [Polars](https://pola.rs), a Rust-backed DataFrame engine designed for performance and scalability.

> âœ… Faster than pandas  
> âœ… Lazy evaluation + multithreaded execution  
> âœ… Memory-efficient on large datasets  
> âœ… Same core metrics: returns, CAGR, Sharpe, drawdowns, volatility, etc.
